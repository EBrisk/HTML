								<h1>This is Magic, the site that will reveal<br />
								all of the 10 types of magic .</h1>
								
								<P><b>Hello, my name is Elhanan Brisk, and I am a junior QA engineer.</b></P>
								<P>Among my hobbies one can find the world of magic.</P>
								<P>I have been connected to this magical world since childhood. I may not necessarily like to perform,
								but I really love the art and mostly what goes on behind the scenes.</P>
								<P>I appreciate the magic behind the magic, the thought behind the trick â€“ 
								how one can make something magical and seemingly impossible happen using natural means.</P>
								<P><b>I see a lot of common ground and overlap between the world of magic and the QA world.</b>
								Similar to a magician meticulously <b>checking every detail</b> in his magic show, a software tester carefully examines each test case and scenario.</P>
								<P>A magician has a "magic kit" with tools, while the software tester has <b>testing environments and testing tools</b> that assist in his work.</P>
								<P>Before the performance, the magician does a general rehearsal to ensure everything works smoothly.
								Similarly, the software tester performs rounds of <b>regression testing</b> to ensure stability.</P>
								<P>Both the magician and the software tester <b>require very high precision and attention to detail</b>
								to ensure that the show or the software runs flawlessly.</P>
								<P>Both magic and software testing require <b>creative thinking and adaptability to different situations,</b>
								and the ability to <b>improvise in changing situations.</b></P>
								<P> The magician invests many hours in practicing techniques and exercises to achieve mastery,
								just as the software tester invests time in <b>learning and Improving test testing methods.</b></P>
								<P>The magician invests many hours of practice in rehearsing his techniques and routines in order to achieve perfection and excellence,
								similarly the software tester invests significant time in <b>learning and practicing testing methodologies.</b></P>
								<P>And just as in magic I prefer what goes on behind the scenes, the messy and hard work that no one sees - 
								so too in software testing, I love to delve into the depths of the product and look for bugs in even the most obscure corners of the product.</P>
								<P>And most importantly, like a magician making something disappear from between his hands, I love finding all the bugs - and making them disappear.</P>
												
								<p><b>Magic is the art of illusions and doing impossible things. There are 10 main types of magic, each with its own unique set of techniques and effects. 
								These days magicians combine several types of magic in one magic trick.</b></p>
								<p><b>By clicking on each of the types you can see videos demonstrating the type of magic and even learn a magic or two.</b></p>
